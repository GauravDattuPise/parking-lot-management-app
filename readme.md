
Parking Lot Management Application
We want to build a parking lot management application using REST APIs. Multiple parking
lots want to use this Application.
1. Platform should be able to support multiple parking lots
2. There are different types of vehicles: Two-Wheeler, Hatchback Car, SUV Car
3. Each parking lot has separate capacity for each kind of vehicle.
4. There are different hourly rate cards for each kind of vehicle
a. Ex : (0-2 hrs 20 Rs, 2-4 hrs 40 Rs).
Assumptions :
You can seed data for these
1. Parking Lots
2. Capacity of parking lot for each kind of vehicle
3. Rate card for each vehicle kind
Demonstrate :
1. Park a Vehicle at a given parking lot (should fail if the lot is full)
2. Exit from the parking area and tell the amount due for the duration.
3. Given a vehicle no., see complete parking history (Lot, Area, Duration, Amount Paid)
Expectation from this round:
1. Demonstrable code is the first expectation. To do this, you can choose any interface you
are comfortable with - CLI, WebApp, MobileApp, APIs or even simply run the code
via Tests or a main method.
2. Code should be extensible.
3. Clean professional level code.
4. Functional Completeness including good modelling.
5. Backend Database with modelling. (Preferably MongoDb)
